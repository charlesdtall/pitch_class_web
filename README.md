PITCH CLASS WEB
===============

## What's the end-goal?

Ultimately, I want this page to be a tool for composers to learn how different Pitch Class Sets (PC Set) (scales, chords, etc.) are related to each other. I want to be able to take any two sets and figure out how compatible they are for composing with each other and modulating between them, similar to the Circle of Fifths, but for a broader selection of pitch material.

## How far along is it?

So far, I have only created a bare-bones version of the Neighbor Checker, which can take any two sets and return information about whether or not they are directly related by a single semitone (as two keys next to each other on the Circle of Fifths are). For the next steps on this particular program, see the top of the areNeighbors.js file.

## What's next?

Immediately? Undecided, but I will update this file as I decide what is to come for this project.

Ultimately, I'd like to make an interactive graph where each node is a PC Set and each edge represents a semitone connection to another set, allowing composers to see how far away different sets are and what the various possibilities are for getting there.
